## About My Score Board
The purpose of this score board is to act like a normal basket ball score board.

I used HTML and CSS for the layout and colours and fonts and buttons while I used JavaScript to 
make the buttons work the way they did.

The +1, +2 and +3 buttons when clicked, add 1, 2 and 3 to the home or guest scores respectively
while the "New Game" button, resets the score coard in case there is a mistake or they
need to start a new game.


Happy Coding!
